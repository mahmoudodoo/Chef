# This video demo is meant to provide an overview of the manage Chef WebUI
# and using it to view node details.
# I recommend checking out the above links to learn more about managing organizations,
# users, groups, cookbooks, and clients.

# I also demonstrate the parallels between the "node" attributes tab, and the node object
# that we queried inside of the server.rb template index.html.erb.
# These node attributes are stored and indexed by your Chef server!
