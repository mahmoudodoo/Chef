# In this video I create an account on Hosted Chef (at manage.chef.io)
# You'll need to sign-up with your name, company, email, and username.
# After signing up, you'll verify your email address.

# After verifying your account and signing in, you'll be prompted to
# create a new organization, whose name will need to be unique on
# the server. Once you've created the unique organization,
# download the "Starter Kit" to your local machine.

# The starter kit will contain a directory called chef-repo, which
# you should unzip and move to an easily-accessible directory.
# I move the chef-repo to my home directory, ie
# /Users/username/chef-repo or c:\Users\username\chef-repo

# After moving the chef-repo, navigate into it inside a terminal
# or powershell session. If using Windows, I recommend launching
# powershell through the 'ChefDK' Desktop icon, which ensures
# that the Chef development tools have been loaded into your path.

# Once you've moved into the chef-repo, check your connectivity to the
# Hosted Chef organization you created with:

knife client list

# which should return ORGANIZATION_NAME-validator. If so, you're connected!
# If not, check to make sure you've navigated into the chef-repo directory.

# Now, let's upload some cookbooks!

# I recommend downloading the 'cookbooks' directory from the 3-1 'code' 
# to attached to this video, or you can copy them out of your vagrant machine.

# Download the 'apache' cookbook, and move it into the 'cookbooks' directory
# of the chef-repo, ie ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/apache or c:\Users\username\chef-repo\cookbooks\apache

# Ignoring the 'starter' cookbook (which you could delete), 
# you should now have a directory structure like this:

└── chef-repo
    ├── README.md
    ├── cookbooks
    │   └── apache
    │       ├── Berksfile

    └── roles
        └── starter.rb


# From the chef-repo directory, you can now upload the apache cookbook to the Chef server:

knife cookbook upload apache

# Please make sure you're in the proper directory ~/chef-repo/ in order to upload the cookbook.
# You can check your work with:

knife cookbook list

# Well done! You're not setup with a Chef server.
