4-6 Server artifacts - roles, environments, data bags

# Disclamer: I do not demonstrate all of the code needed to setup the demo for this section.
# This example ties a lot of pieces together! It would be great for you to give this a shot,
# and you could consider it a further exercise for self-study on using other advanced Chef server
# components like roles, environments, and data bags.

# I have attached my complete chef-repo for your benefit, but you'll still need to learn about
# the process of creating and uploading roles, environments, and data bags.

# To get you started I recommend checking out the included documentation to learn about
# how to create and manage these artifacts. You can then use my code to create users on your nodes,
# and force your index.html page to display the node's environment as shown.

# I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors with Chef, and thanks for joining me for
# the Learning Chef course!

# Roles are a way to manage the run-list for a particular type of node, such as webservers,
# load-balancers, or databases.
# They describe the run-list for a set of nodes that are assigned that role.

# In this class I create roles, environments, and data bags locally on my workstation before uploading
# them to the Chef server. You can also create these artifacts directly on the Chef server using
# knife or the WebUI.

# Managing environments is very similar to managing roles. Environments restrict the versions of cookbooks
# that a node should run. When combined with a role control can become very simple.
# I again create environments locally and upload them with knife.

# Data bags are custom sets of JSON data that are stored on the Chef server and accessible to your
# nodes when they converge. For data bags your must create the bag on the Chef server before contents
# can be uploaded to it. You can again create them locally and upload them like I typically do.

# I wrote my own cookbook to manage users for this demo. For a more production-like scenario, check
# out the users cookbook on the Chef Supermarket:
