2-3 Organizing recipes with cookbooks

External Resources:

http://docs.chef.io/cookbooks.html

# Commands List:
# These commands are meant to be run from inside the VAGRANT instance, after running 'vagrant ssh'

chef --help
chef generate --help

mkdir cookbooks
chef generate cookbook cookbooks/apache

# next I install the 'tree' package, which is NOT related to Chef.
# The 'tree' command is meant to help examine the directory structure of your cookbook.

sudo yum install tree -y
tree

# I then describe what each file in the cookbook tree looks like:

cookbooks
└── apache
    ├── Berksfile
    ├── README.md
    ├── chefignore
    ├── metadata.rb
    ├── recipes
    │   └── default.rb
    ├── spec
    │   ├── spec_helper.rb
    │   └── unit
    │       └── recipes
    │           └── default_spec.rb
    └── test
        └── recipes
            └── default_test.rb

# you can check what's inside each file with the 'cat' commands, like so:

cat cookbooks/apache/README.md
cat cookbooks/apache/recipes/default.rb
