# This video is some simple information about learning Ruby and Chef. I mention that the best way
# to learn Chef is to practice with Chef resources, not by jumping into pure Ruby code.
# After you've mastered the basics of Chef it could be great to try some other Ruby tutorials to
# learn about some of the more complex things you can do inside of recipes.
